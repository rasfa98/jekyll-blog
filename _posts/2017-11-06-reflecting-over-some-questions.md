## What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?
### Compare to regular CSS
### Which techniques did you use?
### Pros and cons?

## What do you think of static site generators?
### What type of projects are they suitable for?

## What is robots.txt and how have you configured it for your site?

## What is humans.txt and how have you configured it for your site?
It's a file containing information about the team that have worked on the site. It also shows information about the IDE used for developing the site together with the different standards (HTML5, CSS3) and components (Jekyll, Sass). The file also contains the date when the site was last updated.

## How did you implement comments to blog posts?
When implementing comments to my blog posts I used a service called *Disqus*. It makes it possible for the users to comment on every blog post, since I'm using jekyll which allows me to add the *Disqus* service to every post.html file.

## What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?
