<p>My name is Rasmus and I'm 18 years old and studies Web Programing at Linnaeus University.
My main hobbies are programing (of course), playing guitar and running. I moved to Kalmar for my studies
but I'm originaly from Blekinge, a place located in the south of Sweden.</p>

<p>When I'm finished with my education I want to work with different types of programing, either for a company or
as a freelance.</p> 

<p>Here comes a list with some of the different programing languages/frameworks I have tried/worked with:</p>

    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Python</li>
</ul>
