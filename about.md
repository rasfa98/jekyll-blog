My name is **Rasmus** and I'm 18 years old and studying *Web Programing* at *Linnaeus University*.
My main hobbies are programing (of course), playing guitar and running. I moved to Kalmar for my studies
but I'm originaly from Blekinge, a place located in the south of Sweden.

When I'm finished with my education I want to work with different types of programing, either for a company or
as a freelance. 

Here comes a list of the different programing languages I have tried/worked with:

* C++
* C#
* JavaScript
* Python
